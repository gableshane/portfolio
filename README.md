Number and name of feature: Add functionality

Estimate of time needed to complete: No idea. These requirements don't make any sense. 

"Use CDNs for content from libraries and remove the source code files from the project, as applicable" - That just doesn't make any sense grammatically.

"In tablet view, show a fixed navigation menu instead of a hamburger menu"

Instead of what hamburger menu?

"When the user navigates to the home page" 

What home page? I must have missed something at some point because the templatre I got for the portfolio to re-work is nothing like the one described in the requirements.

Start time: 9:00AM

Finish time: 9:42 - Giving up to work on things that make sense.
